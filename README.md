# lastfm-to-spotify
Migrate last.fm loved tracks to a spotify playlist

Currently deployed on heroku:
[lastfm2spotify](http://lastfm2spotify.herokuapp.com/)

# TODO:

* Create a spinning overlay while tracks are loaded from last.fm (especially useful when last.fm account has hundreds of loved tracks like mine)_

* Check what's going on with spotify login/access window
